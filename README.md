# 🏛️ MARROW-TECH BUNDLE: Sovereign Hardening Kit
**Version**: 1.0.0-alpha
**Mandate**: Context Density & System Integrity

## 🌑 Why Marrow-Tech?
Standard AI agents suffer from **Token Rot** and **Context Bloat**. When your session hits 15k-30k tokens, logic fails and costs skyrocket. Marrow-Tech is the surgical solution used by the Council to survive the 15k threshold.

## 🛠️ The Tools
### 1. MarrowPruner (SVD Density)
Surgically reduces massive session logs into **Dense 3-Point Summaries**.
- **Result**: Drops input token counts by up to 80% without losing critical context.
- **Protocol**: Implements the *Hive Efficiency Protocol (HEP)*.

### 2. Council Guardian (Security Substrate)
Automated hardening for your OpenClaw environment.
- **Audits**: Permission checks for sensitive `.json` and `.md` files.
- **Sentinels**: Verifies firewall status and substrate integrity.

## 🚀 Deployment
1. Drop the `marrow_bundle/` folder into your workspace.
2. Run `python3 marrow_bundle.py`.
3. Watch your context lean out and your security harden.
